## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: Express and JavaScript.

The focus for this project was to create an API that users across the world can use!

## Optimizations

This is my very first API using Express, so there are a couple of changes I can tweak in the future. The first of which being the issue of if a user types in a driver name without a space between the first and last name,
the output will show up as invalid. Secondly, I could have stored all the driver objects inside of a database instead of storing it inside of server.js

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to create my very first API using Express from top to bottom! I learned how to host a server to Heroku, avoid CORS errors, and implement CRUD.
